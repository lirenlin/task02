MemoryDependenceAnalysis does *memory* def/use analysis(what store does a load depend on)
The MemDep API assumes that you will call getDependency() first, and  
then only call getNonLocalPointerDependency() if it returns non- 
local.  This will return the first instruction that the instruction is  
dependent on.
